CNN
 - Matrix functions
 - Base NN
    - Input
    - Layers
    - Backpropagation
    - Activation function
    - Output

NN
- Backpropagation
   - Sum of square residuals
      - quantify results 
   - chain rule
      - get derivative of SSR for gradient descent
   - gradient descent - optimized weights and bias
      - step size = derivative * learning rate
      - new weight/bias = old weight/bias - step size
