Project Summary:

1.  Business questions:
    * What pattern/trend can you find in the customers who purchased bikes vs those who did not?
      - What relationships can you find between the feature columns and the target column?
      - Which feature(s) is/are highly correlated with the target?
    * Can you build model to predict if a new customer would buy a bike?
      - How can you choose between all available classification models?
      - How can you optimize these models?
2.  EDA Summary:

|![alt_text](https://github.com/zinogore/Personal_Projects/blob/main/Bike_Sales/assets/imgs/MartialStatus_Gender_PurchaseChoice.png)|<ul><li>The distribution between Married and Single is about even. Being single has an increased probability of purchasing a bike.</li><li>The Gender distribution between Male and Female is about even. Gender does not affect purchasing choice.</li></ul>|
|![alt_text](https://github.com/zinogore/Personal_Projects/blob/main/Bike_Sales/assets/imgs/Income_Children_PurchaseChoice.png)|<ul><li>The 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of income is 30k, 60k and 70k respectively. Income does not affect purchasing choice.</li><li>The 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of having children is 0, 2 and 3 respectively. Having lesser children increases probability of purchasing a bike.</li></ul>|
